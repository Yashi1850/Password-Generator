This project is a password generator that uses four different algorithms to create secure and customizable passwords. The available algorithms are:
Simple Random Password,
Pronounceable Password,
Passphrase Generator,
Cryptographically Secure Password.


Features:


Simple Random Password: Generates a random password consisting of letters, numbers, and symbols. This is useful for creating quick passwords without special requirements.

Pronounceable Password: Creates passwords that are easier to remember and pronounce by combining syllables and avoiding complex characters.

Passphrase Generator: Produces a passphrase by combining several random words. This method generates longer passwords that are easy to remember but still secure.

Cryptographically Secure Password: Uses cryptographic algorithms to generate highly secure passwords, suitable for high-security applications.
